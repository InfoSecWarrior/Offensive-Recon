# WHOIS.

WHOIS is a valuable tool for those who manage domain names and IP addresses, and for those who need to verify the authenticity of a domain name or IP address. It provides important information about the registration and ownership of a domain name, and can help protect against cybercrime and fraud.

## Reverse Whois.

Reverse Whois (also known as Reverse IP Lookup) is a method of searching for domain names and other information associated with a particular individual or organization. Unlike a traditional Whois lookup, which provides information about a specific domain, a reverse Whois search allows you to find all the domain names associated with a specific person or organization.
