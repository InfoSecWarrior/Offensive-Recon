# Google Dorking
**Google Dorking**, also known as **Google Hacking,** is a technique used to ***uncover sensitive information*** on the internet by utilizing advanced search techniques with the Google search engine. This involves using specific search ```operators``` and search queries to identify vulnerable websites and servers that may contain exploitable information.

There are two types of google Operators...


## Basic Operators
**Basic operators** are *simple and easy to use*. Here are some examples of basic operators:

No. | Operator | Description
--- | --- | ---
1 | + | Used to include a specific keyword in the search results
2 | - | Used to exclude a specific keyword from the search results
3 | "" | Used to search for an exact phrase
4 | * | Used to match any word in a search query
5 | . | Used to search for a range of numbers
6 | ~ | Used to search for pages that contain similar words
7 | OR | Used to search for pages that contain either one or both keywords

## Advanced Operators
**Advanced operators** are more *specific* and can be used to target your search more effectively. Here are some examples of advanced operators:

| No. | Operator | Description | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | intitle: | Search for a keyword in the title | intitle:keyword |
| 2 | allintitle: | Search for multiple keywords in the title | allintitle:keyword1 keyword2 |
| 3 | inurl: | Search for a keyword in the URL | inurl:keyword |
| 4 | allinurl: | Search for multiple keywords in the URL | allinurl:keyword1 keyword2 |
| 5 | intext: | Search for a keyword in the body of a page | intext:keyword |

### Rules for using Advanced Operators:
- There should be no space between the operator and the search term.
- Searches are NOT case sensitive.
- Use quotation marks if a search term has a space or use a period instead.
- Combine multiple operators for more specific and targeted search results.
