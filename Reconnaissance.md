# Reconnaissance.

**Reconnaissance** is gathering information about a target system or network, to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This process is also known as **Footprinting** or **Information Gathering.**

*There are two main types of reconnaissance:*

**Passive:-** Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system. This can be done through publicly available sources, such as websites and search engines.

**Active:-** Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system. This can include techniques such as network scans and vulnerability scans and can raise the risk of detection.
