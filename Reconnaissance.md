# Reconnaissance.

**Reconnaissance** is gathering information about a target system or network, to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This process, also known as **Footprinting** or **Information Gathering.**

**There are two main types of reconnaissance:**

-   **Passive:-** Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system. This can be done through publicly available sources, such as websites and search engines.

-   **Active:-** Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system. This can include techniques such as network scans and vulnerability scans and can raise the risk of detection.

### Reconnaissance can be performed using various methods, including.

1.  **Network Information.**

    -   Domain name
    -   Internal Domain
    -   IP Address
    -   TCP/UDP
    -   Services
    -   Network topology
    -   Network devices

2.  **Operating System Information.**

    -   Whois
    -   Banner grabbing
    -   Users and group
    -   Dumpster diving
    -   Version
    -   Patch level

3.  **Orgination Information.**

    -   Employee information
    -   Business structure
    -   Marketing and advertising
    -   Prevailing events
    -   Partners
