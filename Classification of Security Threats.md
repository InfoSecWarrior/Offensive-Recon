# Classification of Security Threats

Security threats can be grouped into several major categories based on their **origin** and **target**. Each category includes specific attack types and corresponding mitigation strategies.

---

## 1. Network Attacks

**Definition:**
Attacks targeting the communication infrastructure, including networks and their associated devices.

**Types:**

* **Eavesdropping:** Unauthorized interception of data (e.g., packet sniffing).
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Intercepting and altering communication between parties.
* **Denial of Service (DoS)/Distributed DoS (DDoS):** Overloading a network to disrupt services.
* **IP Spoofing:** Falsifying IP addresses to mimic legitimate users.
* **Session Hijacking:** Taking over a user's active session.
* **DNS Poisoning:** Redirecting users to malicious websites by altering DNS records.

**Mitigation:**

* Encrypt traffic using protocols like **TLS/SSL**.
* Deploy **firewalls** and **intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)**.
* Regularly **monitor and audit** network traffic.

## 2. Host/Node Attacks

**Definition:**
Targeting individual systems or devices within a network to compromise their functionality or data.

**Types:**

* **Malware Infections:** Viruses, worms, ransomware, or spyware affecting a host.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Exploiting weak passwords or unpatched vulnerabilities.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher access levels to compromise the host.
* **Rootkits:** Hiding malicious processes from detection.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information from a node.

**Mitigation:**

* Ensure **endpoint security** with updated antivirus and anti-malware tools.
* Apply **security patches and updates** promptly.
* Use **strong access controls** and apply the **principle of least privilege**.

## 3. Natural Threats

**Definition:**
Non-human threats caused by environmental or natural phenomena.

**Examples:**

* **Earthquakes:** Damaging data centers or server rooms.
* **Floods:** Water damage to critical infrastructure.
* **Lightning/Power Surges:** Causing outages or hardware failures.
* **Fires:** Destroying physical systems.

**Mitigation:**

* Maintain **Disaster Recovery Plans (DRPs)** and **Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)**.
* Use **redundant systems** and **off-site backups**.
* Install **surge protectors** and **uninterruptible power supplies (UPS)**.
* Ensure **environmental monitoring and control systems** in server rooms.

## 4. Physical Threats

**Definition:**
Threats to the tangible infrastructure supporting IT systems.

**Examples:**

* **Theft of Devices:** Laptops, servers, or storage devices.
* **Unauthorized Physical Access:** Intruders accessing secure areas.
* **Vandalism:** Deliberate damage to equipment.
* **Tampering:** Modifying hardware to introduce vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**

* Implement **access control systems** (e.g., biometric authentication).
* Use **surveillance systems** and **security personnel**.
* Secure equipment with **locks and cable ties**.
* Perform **regular physical security audits**.

## 5. Human Threats

**Definition:**
Risks posed by human actions, either intentional or accidental.

**Types:**

* **Insider Threats:** Employees misusing their access, either maliciously or negligently.
* **Social Engineering:** Manipulating individuals to reveal sensitive information (e.g., phishing).
* **Human Errors:** Misconfigurations, accidental deletions, or weak password practices.
* **Sabotage:** Deliberate acts to harm an organization.

**Mitigation:**

* Conduct **regular security awareness training**.
* Implement **strict access control and monitoring**.
* Enforce **robust password policies** and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
* Maintain **clear guidelines** for handling sensitive data.
