## 10. What is Penetration testing?

**Penetration testing,** also known as **"pen testing"** or **"ethical hacking,"** is the process of legally and ethically simulating an attack on a computer system, network, or web application to *identify vulnerabilities and assess the security of the system.* The goal of penetration testing is to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an attacker and to evaluate the effectiveness of the current security controls in place.
	
## 11. What are the different types of penetration testing?
	
**There are three types of penetration testing...**

**1. Black Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has no prior knowledge of the system and simulates an attack from the outside. This simulates a real-world scenario where an attacker does not have any knowledge about the system.
			
-   **There are two types of black box penetration testing:**
				
	-   **External black box testing.**

    -	**Internal black box testing.**

**2. Gray Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has some prior knowledge of the system, simulating an attack from an insider or someone who has already gained access to the system.

**3. White Box Testing:-** In this type of testing, the tester has complete knowledge of the system and simulates an attack from the inside. This type of testing is used to identify vulnerabilities that are not exposed to external attackers. 
		
-   **There are two types of white box penetration testing:**

    -   **Dynamic white box testing.**
					
	-   **Static white box testing.**

## 12. Which of the approaches are used in penetration testing?

-   **1. Reconnaissance(Footprinting):-** Gather information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports, and software versions.

    There are two main types of reconnaissance:

    -   **Passive:-** Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system. This can be done through publicly available sources, such as websites and search engines.


	-   **Active:-** Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target system. This can include techniques such as network scans and vulnerability scans, and can raise the risk of detection.

-   **2. Scanning:-** Use tools to scan the target system for vulnerabilities and open ports and Banner Grabbing.
	
-   **3. Gaining Access:-** Attempt to gain access to the target system through various means such as network, OS, or application vulnerabilities. This may also include escalating privileges to gain higher access.
	
-   **4. Reporting:-** Document the findings and recommend remediation steps.

## 13. What are the different phases or steps involved in the hacking process?

-   **1. Reconnaissance:-** Gather information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports, and software versions. This can be done through passive or active means.

-   **2. Scanning:-** Use tools to scan the target system for vulnerabilities and open ports, and perform banner grabbing.

-   **3. Gaining Access:-** Attempt to gain access to the target system through various means such as network, OS, or application vulnerabilities. This may also include escalating privileges to gain higher access.

-   **4. Maintaining Access:-** Once access is gained, maintain access by injecting backdoors, trojans, using the system as a launchpad, sniffing/monitoring the network, and using resources.

-   **5. Clearing Tracks:-** Cover up any traces of the hacking activity by destroying proof and hiding any tools or files used during the hack.

-   **6. Reporting:-** Document the findings and recommend remediation steps to improve the security of the target system.

## 15. What is the CIA Triad?

The CIA triad is a model for information security that consists of three components: 
	**Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.**
		
-	**Confidentiality** means that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access and is only available to authorized individuals.

-	**Integrity** ensures that the data remains unaltered and uncorrupted, and that it is not subject to unauthorized modifications during transmission.

-	**Availability** refers to the ability of authorized users to access the information they need when they need it. This includes ensuring that systems, networks, and data are reliable, and that data can be recovered in the event of a disaster.
	
## 16. What is the Defense in Depth?

**Defense in depth** is a security strategy that involves implementing multiple layers of protection around a system or network to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats. The idea behind defense in depth is that if one layer of security fails, there are multiple additional layers to prevent unauthorized access and minimize damage. This approach helps to create a strong, comprehensive security program that reduces the risk of security breaches and protects against a wide range of threats. Examples of different layers of defense in depth include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access control systems, and security monitoring tools.

		
## 17. What is Vulnerability management?

**Vulnerability management** is the process of identifying, assessing, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in an organization's information systems and data. The goal of vulnerability management is to reduce the risk of successful attacks by identifying and mitigating potential security weaknesses.
	
## 18. What is the difference between Red Team, Blue Team, and Purple Team?

-	**Red Team:-** A red team is a group of security experts who simulate the tactics, techniques, and procedures of real-world attackers to test an organization's security defenses and identify weaknesses. The goal of a red team is to identify security gaps before attackers do and help organizations improve their overall security posture.

-	**Blue Team:-** A blue team is a group of security professionals who are responsible for defending an organization against cyber threats. The blue team is focused on detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents. They are the first line of defense in an organization's security strategy.

-	**Purple Team:-** A purple team is a combination of red and blue teams that work together to identify and mitigate security risks. The purple team is responsible for both simulating attacks and detecting and responding to security incidents. The goal of a purple team is to improve the overall security posture of an organization by combining the strengths of both red and blue teams.
