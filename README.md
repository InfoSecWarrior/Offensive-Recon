# Reconnaissance
[Reconnaissance](https://github.com/InfoSecWarrior/Offensive-Recon/blob/main/Reconnaissance.md#reconnaissance) is gathering information about a target system or network, to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited. This process is also known as Footprinting or Information Gathering.
		

## Reconnaissance Methodology
Reconnaissance methodology often called reconnaissance (or recon), is used in military and intelligence contexts to describe gathering information about an enemy or potential target. It involves collecting data, analyzing it, and drawing conclusions based on the available evidence.

**A Methodical Approach to Reconnaissance.**
