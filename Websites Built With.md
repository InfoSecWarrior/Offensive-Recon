# Websites Built With – Technologies, Tools, and Security

## 1. Common Website Files

| File                           | Purpose                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `readme.html` / `.txt` / `.md` | Site or software details, version info |
| `license.txt`                  | Licensing terms                        |
| `feed` / `feed.xml`            | RSS/Atom feeds                         |

**Security Risks**: Information disclosure, fingerprinting, and aiding attackers. Tools like WhatWeb, BuiltWith, and Wappalyzer often use these files for detection.
