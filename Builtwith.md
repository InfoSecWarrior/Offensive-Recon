### **Common Files to Check on Websites**
Websites often include standard files like `readme.txt`, `readme.md`, `readme.html`, `license.txt`, and `feed`. These files can provide insights into the website's configuration, technologies, and licensing. You can manually check for these files by appending them to the website's URL, for example:

- `https://www.tesla.com/license.txt`
- `https://www.tesla.com/readme.txt`
- `https://www.tesla.com/feed`

These files may contain:
- **Readme Files**: Information about the website's setup, technologies, or usage instructions.
- **License Files**: Details about the software licenses used by the website.
- **Feeds**: RSS or Atom feeds that provide updates or content summaries.
