**What is a Security Threat?**
A **security threat** is anything that can **harm your data, steal information, damage systems**, or **stop services**. It affects:

* **Confidentiality** – Keeping information private
* **Integrity** – Keeping information accurate
* **Availability** – Making sure systems work properly

---

## 1. Malware (Malicious Software)

**What it is:** Harmful software that attacks your computer or system.

**Types:**

* **Virus** – Attaches to files and spreads
* **Worm** – Spreads through networks automatically
* **Ransomware** – Locks files and asks for money
* **Trojan** – Looks safe but is harmful
* **Spyware/Adware** – Spies on you or shows bad ads

---

## 2. Social Engineering

**What it is:** Tricking people into giving away secret information.

**Examples:**

* **Phishing** – Fake emails that steal info
* **Vishing** – Fake phone calls for stealing data
* **Pretexting** – Fake stories to gain trust
* **Baiting** – Fake downloads or offers with hidden viruses

---

## 3. Insider Threats

**What it is:** People inside your organization causing harm (on purpose or by mistake).

**Types:**

* **Malicious Insiders** – Employees who steal or damage data
* **Negligent Insiders** – People who are careless (like using weak passwords)

---

## 4. Unauthorized Access

**What it is:** When someone breaks into your system without permission.

**Common Methods:**

* **Brute Force** – Guessing passwords again and again
* **Credential Stuffing** – Using stolen usernames/passwords
* **Privilege Escalation** – Getting higher access than allowed

---

## 5. DoS / DDoS Attacks

**DoS (Denial of Service):**
One computer sends too much traffic to crash a site.

**DDoS (Distributed DoS):**
Thousands of computers send traffic together to crash the system.

---

## 6. Data Breaches

**What it is:** When private data is leaked or stolen.

**Effects:**

* Loss of sensitive info
* Legal trouble
* Damage to company image

---

## 7. APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats)

**What it is:** Smart and long-term attacks by expert hackers to steal important data.

**Features:**

* Highly skilled attackers
* Secretly stay in system for months
* Use advanced tools

---

## 8. Vulnerability Exploitation

**What it is:** Hacking systems that are not updated or are set up incorrectly.

**Examples:**

* **Zero-Day Exploits** – Attack on new bugs before a fix exists
* **Misconfiguration** – Using weak/default settings (like “admin/admin”)

---

## 9. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack

**What it is:** Hacker sits between two users and listens or changes their messages.

**Examples:**

* Reading unprotected data
* Faking secure sites (HTTPS spoofing)
* Taking over online sessions

---

## 10. IoT (Internet of Things) Threats

**What it is:** Hacking smart devices like cameras, fridges, or smart TVs.

**Risks:**

* Weak security settings
* No updates
* Used in bigger attacks (like DDoS)

---

## 11. Supply Chain Attacks

**What it is:** Hacking a third-party vendor to break into a company.

**Examples:**

* Putting malware in software updates
* Attacking supplier systems to access customer data

---

## 12. Cloud Security Threats

**What it is:** Problems in cloud storage or services.

**Issues:**

* Publicly open storage (e.g., Amazon S3 buckets)
* Weak or unsafe APIs
* Insider threats from cloud provider staff

---

## 13. Emerging Threats

**What it is:** New types of smart and future cyber attacks.

**Examples:**

* **AI-powered attacks** – Use artificial intelligence to hack
* **Quantum attacks** – Future tech that can break encryption
* **Deepfakes** – Fake audio/video used for scams
